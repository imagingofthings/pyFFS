@article{Matsushima2009,
	abstract = {A novel method is proposed for simulating free-space propagation. This method is an improvement of the angular spectrum method (AS). The AS does not include any approximation of the propagation distance, because the formula thereof is derived directly from the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld equation. However, the AS is not an all-round method, because it produces severe numerical errors due to a sampling problem of the transfer function even in Fresnel regions. The proposed method resolves this problem by limiting the bandwidth of the propagation field and also expands the region in which exact fields can be calculated by the AS. A discussion on the validity of limiting the bandwidth is also presented.},

Comparison between the calculations made using our algorithm and direct numeric integration show a very good agreement, while the computation speed is increased by orders of magnitude. {\textcopyright} 2009 Optical Society of America.},

Whereas the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is based on integral roots of unity e-2$\pi$/n, the fractional Fourier transform is based on fractional roots of unity e-2$\pi$i$\alpha$ where $\alpha$ is arbitrary. The fractional Fourier transform and the corresponding fast algorithm are useful for such applications as computing DFTs of sequences with prime lengths, computing DFTs of sparse sequences, analyzing sequences with noninteger periodicities, performing high-resolution trigonometric interpolation, detecting lines in noisy images, and detecting signals with linearly drifting frequencies. In many cases, the resulting algorithms are faster by arbitrarily large factors than conventional techniques.},
